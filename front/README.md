Design System Component, recipes and snowflakes from [this article](https://medium.com/@janelle.wg/atomic-design-pattern-how-to-structure-your-react-application-2bb4d9ca5f97)

### Atomic Design

Atoms > Molecules > Organisms > Templates > Pages

- Atoms: buttons, input, form label...
- Molecules: Grouping Atoms
- Organisms: Combining molecules, navigation bar, cards...
- Templates: Groups of Organisms to form a page
- Pages: application

### Design System Components, recipes and snowflakes

- DSC: Shared components, content agnostic and context agnostic
- Recipes: Compositions of DSC living across a product
- Snowflakes: Components not reused in a product, they are unique
